## My Projects

### Sensor fusion for autonomous vehicles
- **Description**: This project involves the development of a sensor fusion algorithm that combines data from multiple sensors (LiDAR, cameras, and radar) to improve the accuracy and reliability of object detection and tracking in autonomous vehicles.
- **Technologies Used**: Kalman Filter, Carla, ROS2
- **GitHub**: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/sachinkum0009/carla-multi-sensor-fusion)

### Nav2GPT: Let's Talk with Robots
- **Description**: This project combines the power of LLM with Nav2 API to control the robot by just talking to the robot, which is how we suppose to talk with the robots.
- **Technologies Used**: Ollama, Llama3, ROS2, Nav2, Whisper
- **GitHub**: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/sachinkum0009/nav2gpt)

### Coffee Robot: Personalize robot to deliver the coffee
- **Description**: This project involves the development of a personal robot like turtlebot3 which is integrated with various sensors like LiDAR, IMU, camera, and wheel encoders for localization, mapping, navigation with path planning, and obstacle avoidance.
- **Technologies Used**: ROS2, Nav2, LiDAR, IMU, Edge
- **GitHub**: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/sachinkum0009/Coffee-Robot)
